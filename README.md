# Reaper_bro
Creates a little pixel art Reaper at the bottom of your screen that just kinds does his own thing.

Can edit the variables to change speed and frames of animation etc (sorry the codes a little sloppy).

Note: the '.gif' files should be in the same directory as the reaper_program.py file
